  VASP-5.4.4 and VASP-6.2.0

An importante updating into the routine which calculates the 
isolated potential was released to fix the behavior and the stability 
of the charged defects calculations for slabs/2D systems using the SCPC 
method. 

A test case is provided here to verify if the new patches are working properly 
with the new release.
